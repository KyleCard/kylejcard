title: When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer

description: 'This classic poem by Walt Whitman recounts his shifting attention away from the data presented during an astronomy lecture, to boredom. Whitman invokes the imagery of a bird as he "rises and glides out" into the night to experience the beauty of the stars firsthand. This poem reminds me to step back on occassion from the bench or the terminal, and appreciate the elegant evolutionary processes that have shaped the complexity and diversity of life.'

by Walt Whitman

When I heard the learn’d astronomer,                                                         
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,                                 
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,                           
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,                 
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,                                         
Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,                                            
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,                                         
Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
